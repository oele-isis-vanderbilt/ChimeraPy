Contributing
============

Hello! Glad that you are interested in contributing to this open-source
project. Reading the :ref:`Framework documentation<framework>` 
provides an overview in how ChimeraPy works, which should be a good 
starting point. Additionally, the API documentation helps describe the source code.

Development Environment
=======================
To create your Python development environment, you can use the
``chimerapy_env.yml`` to install the required dependencies. This file 
can be found in the ``.github/CONTRIBUTING`` folder.

Developer Documentation
=======================

Below is the developer documentation, which includes all the classes,
methods, and modules used by ChimeraPy.

Looking forward to your contributions and making multimodal research 
easier!
